DATA ACCESS WITH DIRECTQUERY IN PIZZA SALES REPORT:
The Pizza Sales Report uses DirectQuery mode, allowing real-time access to the SQL Server database without importing data into Power BI. 
This ensures the report always shows the latest sales and order details. It helps maintain data security, reduces storage needs, and eliminates manual refreshes.
